## Description
This was fullstack web development project created for the Spring 2023 Web Development course at FAU. The goal of this project was to create a database
management system where users can add students and their information to a database, retrieve a student by their given id, search for multiple students by 
an inputted last name, delete students by their ID, update student information, and finally show all student information in a table. As with any project,
I used this project to improve my react skills by cutting unnecessary code out by adding one liners that do the same thing, such as changing out the 
onChange functions to simply call the useState function. I also practiced with using javascript mapping functions to create output html tables in
the return functions instead of using for loops like I did for my previous Poll App project. This project was very fun, and I look forward to workiing
on many more like it in the future.
